# ⚙️ Compression Machine Simulator

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Compression Machine Simulator! This Python-based project serves as a conceptual simulation of a compression machine. While the current version focuses on demonstrating my programming skills and the core principles involved, it offers a visual representation of material compression. Due to time constraints, the class structure is currently consolidated within a single file, though it's designed with modularity in mind for future enhancements.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Compression Machine Simulator up and running on your Linux (Ubuntu) system.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

   1- Python 3: You can check your Python version by running:
                                
      python3 --version in Bash
 
    2- Linux os

### Installation & Setup


1.  Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
    
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This isolates the project's packages from your system's global Python packages.

    bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
   

3.  Install Dependencies using the following command in Bash:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

### Running the Simulator

Once the setup is complete, you can run the simulator.

1.  Activate your virtual environment (if not already active):
    bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    

2.  Run the main simulator script:
     
    bash
    python3 main.py
    
    The simulator window should now appear.

3.  Deactivate the virtual environment:**
    When you are finished using the simulator, you can exit the virtual environment:
    bash
    deactivate
